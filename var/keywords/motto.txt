The rough times are gonna come ,
but they have not come to stay they have come to pass,

Don't say `i'm having a bad day`, say `i'm having a character building day.`

You concentrate on this opportunity,
You don't worry about tomorrorow,
You concentrate on this opportunity,
With all your might, with all your soul, with all your heart
You focus on this and tommorrow will take care of itself

Write down at least 5 reasons on why you wont give up,
on what is going to make you unstoppable. 
Why you must be unreasonable,

because logical, practical thinking says that you can't do it today.

But if you want to produce unreasonable results in your life,
You've got to be an unreasonable person,
You've got to be an uncommon person

It's very important for you to believe that you are the one
That you are entitled to this, you are supossed to have this
This is your calling, This is your time

When you no longer focus on the obsticle
When you no longer care what people think
or what they might say

When you no longer find the need to seek their approval, it's done

The presure within you is greater than the pressure outside of you..
